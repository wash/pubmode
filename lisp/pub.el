Define the pattern of the BibTeX key. 

You can access the following special fields:

%N Last name of first author (first letter uppercase), eg. Smith
#N Last name of first author (all lowercase), eg. smith
@N Last name of first author (all uppercase), eg. SMITH

%J Journal abbreviation (first letters uppercase), eg. J_Mol_Biol
#J Journal abbreviation (all lowercase), eg. j_mol_biol
@J Journal abbreviation (all uppercase), eg. J_MOL_BIOL

%P PubMed ID, eg. 12621444

%Y Year (four digits), eg. 2008
#Y Year (two digits), eg. 08


The length of the author field can be limited by appending the
number of characters to the N, eg. @N3 would give SMI instead of
SMITH. 

The default key is %N:%Y, which gives keys of the form Smith:2008.
